st.write("""We also advise to use models that support unsupervised learning, as in practice it is extremely difficult to classify all possible anomalies â€“ malicious data is a very broad term, so algorithms that heavily rely on an existing labeled data (such as decision trees) would not be useful in a real-world scenario.  
         Instead, we recommend using models that are trained on representing a benign system and find malicious data by identifying deviations from the expected result, as benign data is expected and follows the artificially learned complex set of rules.""")
